FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Game: Centipede Fighters

Description:
For our final project game, what we will be doing is a twist off of the classic game 
centipede.  There are a few different rules that will apply to increase the difficulty. 
First and fore most the game will start out with a small centipede that will grow by 
eating some magical piece of fruit. About 10 seconds into the game there will be a 
second centipede that will be controlled by either another player or by the CPU which 
will be battling the other centipede to be the last "man" standing.  The centipedes 
will try and eat each other while still having the capability to grow by getting to 
the magic fruit first.  If one centipede eats the head of the other centipede it is 
an automatic a game over and the predator wins.  The CPU will be able to tell who 
won because there will be only one head of a centipede left.  Centipede has been a 
very popular game since the start of gaming.  it was among the first games on a 
handheld device and still is, if not more, popular than when it launched.  This game 
is for all different ages, but the preferred audience is teenagers and younger kids 
because most kids enjoy the competitive aspect to a game where they can beat their 
friends.  We believe that this game could be a hit and get kids involved with the 
centipede we all came to love as kids.
